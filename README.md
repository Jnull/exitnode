exitnode
========

Configuration, script and instructions for exit nodes.

This is very much a work in progress.

Required packages so far: 

  dnsmasq
  squid3
  apache2 (though any webserver should do)

Assumed distro is debian.

TODO:

Set up tunneling between exit nodes and relay nodes (probably l2tp).

Make the captive portal faker actually work.
